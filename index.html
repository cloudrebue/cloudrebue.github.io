				<h2 style="color: #4154f1;" class="text-left"><strong>DISPARITIES IN HEALTH CARE AND HEALTH</strong></h2>

				<h2 style="color: #4154f1;"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>

				<p>Disparities in health care alludes to the differences of quality of healthcare between people grouped by factors such as; social-economic, environmental differences, gender, ethnicity, sexual identity, nationality, financial positions, locality and many more. Health disparities are usually noticed between minority and majority population as the minorities generally get access to poorer quality due to discrimination and high cost of treatment</p>

				<p>America is a highly diverse country. Some ethnicities found in the United States are African, Hispanics, American Indians, Asian Americans and also Americans from the Middle East. This diversification is ever increasing and majority of the minority groups have lower incomes compared to the majority. It is increasingly important to address issues of gender disparities so as to achieve the goal of access to quality care for all Americans.</p>

				<strong><h2 style="color: #4154f1;">Barriers leading to healthcare disparities</h2> </strong>

				The major cause of health care disparities in the United States is a blend of weakness because of social financial status and lacking frameworks together contribute fundamentally to contrasts in wellbeing status. The financial status of the patient will be the greatest contributor simply because it is unaffordable.

				<p>Healthcare in the country is deemed to be very expensive and insurance coverage is too high and much basic coverage includes expensive co-payments. Household with a more superior income will get access to the best medical care while the low income households will not be able to access it.</p>

				<p>Another cause of healthcare disparity is lack of cultural competence. Despite the fact that cultural competence is even taught is medical schools many healthcare workers are not culturally competent. Cultural competence is the capacity to comprehend, speak with and adequately communicate with individuals across societies. Incompetence here would lead to the patient not accessing the best quality care. Language barriers, verbal and non-verbal communication cues and respect of other peopleâ€™s culture are important elements that healthcare workers affect the quality of healthcare</P>

				<p>In addition to that, location leads to disparities in healthcare. There is a huge disparity in access to healthcare between people living in urban areas and people living in rural areas. In the rural areas it is difficult to access the best care as many specialists tend to reside in urban areas. For this reason patients seeking the best care must travel for hours to access healthcare. Also, the income of people living in rural areas is generally lower than the ones living in urban areas.</p>
