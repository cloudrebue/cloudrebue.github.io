				<h2 style="color: #4154f1;"><strong>Solutions to health disparities</strong></h2>

				<p>To address the issue of ethnicity in healthcare, it is vital to use community mobilizations and advocacies. Community mobilization reduces environmental risks to minority ethnicities by mobilizing communities to acknowledge, receive and accept people of all races. It is a process that has been used to change behavioural activities of individuals through interventions, dialogue and physical activities that bring people together</p>

				<p>The issue of financial barriers to health require governmental interventions. The government should focus more on providing universal healthcare that is also accessible to the lower income communities. There are several ways that the government can help to bring down this cost which include: building more public hospitals, paying for doctors salaries in private hospitals, setting aside more funds into the healthcare systems, purchasing advanced medical diagnostic tools and many more. The government could also set aside a compulsory national health insurance that is based on the income of the individual.</p>

				<p>The issue of cultural competence can be solved by teaching healthcare workers to be culturally competent and continuous seminars for the already employed. Cultural competence is very important as it helps people of various cultures to be able to interact efficiently. Punishments such as suspensions should also be enacted especially to repeat offenders who cause medical errors due to being insensitive to other peopleâ€™s culture.</p>

				<p>The issue of location can be solved by decentralizing the urban areas. Decentralization will lead to the increase in population in rural areas. Also, the government can help by setting up more medical hospitals and schools to encourage more healthcare workers and students to reside in rural areas. Advanced imaging and diagnostic centres should also be erected here to reduce the distance one has to travel to access them.</p>

				<h2 style="color: #4154f1;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>

				<p>In conclusion, healthcare disparity is a serious issue that should be tackled. Quality healthcare is important for all Americans to live a healthy life and be more productive in society. If the issue is not addressed the disparities will only increase and generally they will affect the social, economic and cultural livelihoods of the citizens. The government has a key role to play here as it is the key to providing universal healthcare that is affordable to all Americans despite their socio-economic and cultural diff</p>
